# Linkedin HTML

## Summary
For this challenge, we are going to recreate our LinkedIn Profiles! Besides what we see at the end, HTML is about marking up the structure we expect the content to take when being interpreted by someone else's browser. Spend some time reviewing the assets folder for the profile design you should try to emulate.

### Release 0 - Meta
Setup your `index.html` document with the needed elements. What is the appropriate order?

### Release 1 - Body Structure
Setup the appropriate sections and headings for your page.

### Release 2 - Body Content
Add in the actual content of your profile page. Do you need to refer to image assets? Leave them in your `assets` folder.

Consider the elements that you use (Structural, Semantic). Try to load this page in your browser. What does it look like?

**NOTE:** Leave styling out of it! that will be done in the next challenge.
